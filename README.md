  <h1 align="center">SVG Logo Generator</h1>

  ## Description
  This Node.js command-line application takes user input in order to generate a logo, which is then saved as an SVG file. 
  <br>
  This project is centered around Object-Oriented Programming and further familiarisation with node.js and the dependencies Inquirer and Jest.
  <br>
  Inquirer is utilised to prompt the user within the command line on their logo specification: a triangle, circle or square logo, the fill color and up to 3 characters for the text and on completion an SVG logo will be generated. Jest........

  ## User Story
  ```
  AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
  ```


  ## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
